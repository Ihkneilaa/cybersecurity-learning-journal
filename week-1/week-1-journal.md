# 🧠 Week 1 Journal Entry – Foundations of Cybersecurity

## 📚 What I Learned
This week, I restarted my journey through the Google Cybersecurity Certificate by reviewing Course 1: *Foundations of Cybersecurity*. I learned what cybersecurity is and why it's important in today’s world. I also reviewed the **CIA Triad** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) and how security analysts use it to guide their decisions. I explored different types of cyber threats, the basics of entry-level analyst roles, and what skills are required to succeed.

## 🔍 Real-World Applications
I now understand how security analysts help protect companies from major risks like phishing and ransomware. Knowing about the CIA Triad helps me understand how businesses maintain uptime, secure private data, and ensure accuracy across systems.

## ❓ Things I Still Don’t Fully Understand
- I want to get more familiar with all **8 CISSP security domains**
- I want to practice describing how tools and frameworks are used in real work scenarios

## ⚙️ Activities I Completed
- Reviewed all 4 modules in Course 1
- Created a study guide based on course objectives
- Started this journal to document what I’m learning

## 👩🏽‍🏫 Teach It Back
Cybersecurity is the protection of systems and data from attacks, using frameworks like the CIA Triad to stay secure. Entry-level analysts monitor for suspicious behavior, respond to incidents, and help companies stay safe.

## 📈 Confidence Level: 4/5
I understand most of the material, but want to get more comfortable explaining everything without notes.

## 🎯 Goals for Next Week
- Start Course 2: Understanding threats and business risks
- Research the 8 CISSP domains and summarize them in my own words
- Set up a basic home lab to practice tools as I go# 🧠 Week 1 Journal Entry – Foundations of Cybersecurity
